# positivity-of-automorphic-bundles

We explore the possibility of proving that certain good subvarieties of the good reduction modulo p of the Siegel modular varieties are of log-general type when the prime p is large enough. Our conjecture is now a theorem, you can find the proof in our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05804.
